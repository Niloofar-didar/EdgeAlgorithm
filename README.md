This project is extention of "Data Sharing-Aware Task Allocation in Edge Computing Systems" paper. 
The initial problem stems from allocating servers to various tasks/users that require offloading shared data to the servers for high performance and low latency computation. 
The new algorithm called DSTAR, leverages a heauristic rellocation method and uses the provided algorithm (DSTA) in above paper to increase number of allocated tasks and profit allocated tasks with lower amount of data traffic over the network.
