This project is an extension of the 'Data Sharing-Aware Task Allocation in Edge Computing Systems' paper. The initial problem involves allocating servers to various tasks/users that require offloading shared data to the servers for high performance and low latency computation. The new algorithm, called DSTAR, leverages a heuristic reallocation method and utilizes the provided algorithm (DSTA) in the above paper to increase the number of allocated tasks and maximize profit while minimizing data traffic over the network
